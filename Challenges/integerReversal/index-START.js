/*
Given an integer, return an integer that has the reverse ordering of that which was received. E.g

reverseInteger(-123) // should return -321
Keep the following rules in mind:

The signs must not change i.e -123 becomes -321
The value returned must be an integer.
All insignificant zeroes must be removed i.e 900 becomes 9 and not 009
